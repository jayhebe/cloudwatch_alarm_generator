# Cloudwatch Alarm Generator

## 1. Purpose
As a beginner of the AWS Cloud player, when you create a brand new project or migrate an existing environment (aka. Lift and Shift) to the Cloud, I believe you have to create a lot of EC2 or RDS which are the most common used resources on the AWS Cloud. After that it is a nightmare to create the Cloudwatch alarms for the resources by manual accordingly or sometimes we forget to create alarm for the resources. That is why this Cloudwatch Alarm Generator is here.
